# Change Ringing
Change ringing is a way to produce music with bells by ringing them in a pattern-based sequence. This web application provides the user with a list of methods to select from or, alternatively, allows the user to construct their own method by specifying place notation and stage. This method is then processed into a uniform notation and an image illustrating the musical pattern in addition to an audio file is constructed and displayed to the user.

This web app is built using Python 3 with Pillow for image processing, and Flask for the web framework.
